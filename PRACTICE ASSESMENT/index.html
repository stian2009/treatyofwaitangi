    The Treaty of Waitangi is New Zealand’s founding document. It takes its name from the place<br> in the Bay of Islands where it was first signed, on 6 February 1840. This day is now a public holiday<br> in New Zealand. The Treaty is an agreement, in Māori and English, that was made between the British Crown<br> and about 540 Māori rangatira (chiefs).</div>

    Growing numbers of British migrants arrived in New Zealand in the late 1830s,<br> and there were plans for extensive settlement.<br> Around this time there were large-scale land transactions with Māori, unruly behaviour<br> by some settlers and signs that the French were interested in annexing New Zealand.<br> The British government was initially unwilling to act, but it eventually realised that annexing<br> the country could protect Māori, regulate British subjects and secure commercial interests.<br>

Lieutenant-Governor William Hobson had the task of securing British sovereignty over New Zealand.<br> He relied on the advice and support of, among others, James Busby, the British Resident in New Zealand.<br> The Treaty was prepared in just a few days.<br> Missionary Henry Williams and his son Edward translated the English draft into Māori overnight on 4 February.<br> About 500 Māori debated the document for a day and a night before it was signed on 6 February.</div>
